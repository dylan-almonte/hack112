We based the project off of the retro game Galaga. We used Object Oriented programming to organize our work, and Git Hub for our version control to allow each member to work on separate classes and files simultaneously. We also used different mathematical functions to described the movement of the enemies we spawned. Our main point of focus is that we made the game from scratch with the exception of using a few modules from the cmu cs 15112 website (PIL and PILLOW to import sprites).
